Project Listing from the Eastcoastbands Recording Studio

This is an Excel Spreadsheet of Projects from the East Coast Bands Recording Studio, 
as evidenced by what is found on the hard drives from the studio.

There was one crash of an archived drive around 2009 or 2010 which resulted in the loss 
of a few projects. Most of which was redundantly backed up, All of which presumably was 
in posession by the client at that time. 

There was also a crash on an archived drive in the early 2000's which also resulted in 
the loss of some projects, most of which were either found on a redundant drive but it 
is possible that one or a few may have slipped through the cracks.

In other cases the client may have requested to delete all files related to their project.

As the details emerge about who has what, this file will serve as the latest and up to
date version of what is in storage. That said, from October 2018 on, these files will
may or may not survive as the hard drives are going to be moving to non climate controlled
storage, and because of this, clients are advised to recover their work for it may not be
available to you in the future.
